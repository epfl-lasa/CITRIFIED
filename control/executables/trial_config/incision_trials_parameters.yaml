# CHECKLIST:
# update the fruit number
# update the trial number
# change the position / orientation
# check the insertion depth
# check the cut radius

# TIPS:
# The -X direction in optitrack is the +X direction in the robot. -X moves forward (away from the robot)
# The -Y direction in optitrack is the +Y direction in the robot. -Y moves left
#
# Set the cut radius to 1m for a practically straight line cut
# Set the cut radius to 0.02 for small circle
